## About

The pandemic caused by COVID-19 accelerated scientific progress on searching ways to beat the virus, with medication treatment or a vaccine. 

Thinking about the health professionals, they are spending days and days at the hospital working under 24hrs of stress and not always seeing their families for fear from the coronavirus.  

This affect directly their mental health, increasing the number of burnout syndrome cases in health professionals. 

It shows that more than 7 in 10 professionals today are suffering from burnout in the wake of the pandemic (2). 

A study in China (1) involving 1250 health care workers during the coronavirus crises and reported a result that we should be worried: 

More than 50% had symptoms of depression;

34% insomnia;

45% anxiety;

71% distress. 

The article also said that working in the frontline was an independent risk factor for worse mental health outcomes in all dimensions. 

Thinking about all these questions, we understood that everything that’s going on with the health professionals is touched by small details that can become big problems! We’ll solve it by using better the time of the team works, showing how a good management relieves de overload. 

Prohealth is a website with a program that offers access to all the health professionals working at the hospital. The system will divide these professionals in groups and they will work with a time stipulated. They will have their schedule arranged according to the groups and switched through the week. 

In case someone needs to switch their shift, they can talk between themselves, put it on the system and make a solicitation.
Prohealth offers the hospital management team indicators of team overload prediction through the use of people analytics: a process of collecting, organizing and analyzing data on the behavior of employees, in order to contribute to decision making - anticipating trends and improving the strategy.

Data such as work shift, gender, age, length of service, absence due to covid contagion, all of which can be verified through dashboards offered in the APP. 

Lastly, Prohealth’s proposal is offer both haste and transparency as in management as organization and assertiveness for workers. Avoiding overload and controlling their time of work, we believe that burnout syndrome can be avoided by improving professionals’s quality of life and coming back to the hospital ready to another battle.
